--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. (a) Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The R package 'magma' provides a new set of matrix-class objects with method
functions for matrix and linear algebra operations.  Operations are implemented
using the MAGMA (Matrix Algebra for GPU and Multicore Architectures) library of
C routines optimized for parallel processing on NVIDIA graphics cards and
multicore CPUs (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/).

In particular, the magma package provides optimization for

   * Matrix multiplication
   * Cholesky, LU, and QR factorization
   * Linear solvers based on Cholesky, LU, and QR factorization as well as
     triangular matrices


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. (b) Hardware requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A 64-bit Intel-compatible CPU is required.

* An NVIDIA graphics card with a compute capability designation of 1.3 or
  greater is required.  See Appendix A of this guide for a list of compatible
  cards.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. (c) Supported operating systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Development and testing of the package is performed on 64-bit Ubuntu Linux
  10.04 with.  Other 64-bit Linux distributions should work as well.
  Development is conducted with release 4.3 of the GCC tools; release 4.4 is
  not supported and may cause errors.

* At this time, the package has not been tried on OS X, although input from any
  attempts to do so are welcome.  Windows is not supported currently due to a
  lack of shared MAGMA libraries for that platform.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. (a) Installation of NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUDA is a general purpose parallel computing architecture that leverages the
parallel processors in NVIDIA graphics cards to solve complex computational
problems.  The CUDA Toolkit is a collection of libraries and callable routines
that provide a programming interface to NVIDIA graphics cards.

Perform the following steps to install the CUDA Toolkit version 3.0 or greater
prior to the magma package:

(i)  Go to http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html.

(ii) Follow the Getting Started Guide Linux to install the toolkit and (please)
     verify its installation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. (b) Installation of an LAPACK shared library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A shared LAPACK library must be installed on your system to use magma.  The
following links provide some pre-built LAPACK implementations:

Reference Implementations: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/archives/
Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (ATLAS):
   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
AMD Core Math Library (ACML): http://www.amd.com/acml/
Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL): http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/

Install the shared library using one of the following two methods (for Linux
systems):

  (1) Preferably, have a system administer add the shared library to the
      system-wide linker search path with 'ldconfig'.

  (2) Unpack the files to a local directory <library-path> and add the path
      name to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable.  The typical way
      to do this when using the Bourne Shell is with the command

         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<library-path>

      To make the assignment permanent, place this command in ~/.bashrc.  When
      using the C Shell, the command is

         setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <library-path>

      or, to append the path to an existing assignment,

         setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<library-path>

      which can be place in ~/.cshrc to make the assignment permanent.

      Note that if this method is used to install shared libraries, the library
      path must also be supplied in the appropriate configuration option when
      the R package is installed (see section II(d)).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. (c) Installation of the MAGMA software
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, the MAGMA software (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma) must be installed.  To do
so,

* Extract the source code to a local directory, and follow the instructions
  supplied with the code to make shared libraries 'libmagmablas.so' and
  'libmagma.so'.  Additional help on making the shared magma libraries can be
  found at http://www.hiplar.org/hiplar-M-installation.html#MAGMA.  After making
  the shared libraries, refer to the previous section for instructions on
  installing the libraries.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. (d) Installation of the magma R package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you're ready to install the R package, which is available from
http://cran.r-project.org/package=magma.  Installation may be done from a
terminal command prompt or from within R itself with one of the following
commands:

  Terminal command prompt
  -----------------------
  R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="<options>" magma_<version>.tar.gz

  R command prompt
  ----------------
  install.packages("magma", configure.args = "<options>")

where <option> are optional configuration arguments that can be supplied to
change default files and locations, and include

  --with-r-home=DIR       full path to R installation []
  --with-magma-lib=DIR    full path to MAGMA shared libraries []
  --with-lapack=LIBS      LAPACK shared library [-llapack]
  --with-cuda-home=DIR    full path to CUDA installation [/usr/local/cuda]

LAPACK Option:

The --with-lapack option can be used to link the magma package against
alternative LAPACK shared libraries.  Usage of this option has the general form

   --with-lapack=\"-L<LAPACK-library-path> -l<LAPACK-library-name>\"

where <LAPACK-library-name> should exclude the library filename's 'lib' prefix
and '.so' suffix.  Multiple library paths and names may be given, as required by
the particular LAPACK implementation being used.

Example:

The following illustrate installation of magma package release 0.2.2-1 on a
system in which CUDA is installed in '/opt/cuda', MAGMA shared libraries in
'/opt/magma/lib', and with a ldconfig-registered LAPACK library named
'liblapack.so' (the default for --with-lapack):

  Terminal command prompt
  -----------------------
  R CMD INSTALL \
    --configure-args="
       --with-cuda-home=/opt/cuda \
       --with-magma-lib=/opt/magma/lib" \
    magma_0.2.2-1.tar.gz

  R command prompt
  ----------------
  install.packages("magma",
    configure.args = "--with-cuda-home=/opt/cuda
      --with-magma-lib=/opt/magma/lib"
  )


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Known Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Performance (speed) of the QR solver may be suboptimal due to workarounds for
  a bug in version 1.3.0 of the magma_dgeqrs_gpu routine.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration Errors
--------------------

no acceptable C compiler found
- Compilation of the magma package requires the GCC tools.  Confirm that the gcc
  compiler is installed on your system and that its location is included in the
  program search path.

nvcc or CUDA headers not found!
- Verify that a working installation of the CUDA Toolkit exists on your system.
  See Section II(a).
- Check that the '--with-cuda-home' configuration option is being set equal to 
  the full and correct installation directory for the CUDA Toolkit.  See Section
  II(d).

R not found!
- Verify that a working installation of R exists on your system by starting R
  manually.
- If the '--with-r-home' configuration option is being used, check that it is
  set equal to the full and correct installation directory for R.  See Section
  II(d).


Compilation Errors
------------------

cannot find -llapack
- Check that the shared LAPACK library 'liblapack.so' is installed on your
  system.  If it is not and no other LAPACK libraries exist, install one.  See
  Section II(b).
- If an alternative, installed LAPACK library is desired, then specify it using
  the configuration option '--with-lapack'.  See Section II(d).

cannot find -lmagmablas or -lmagma
- Check that the shared MAGMA libraries 'libmagmablas.so' and 'libmagma.so' are
  installed on your system.  Install them, if not.  Refer to Section II(c).
- If they are installed, try supplying their directory path using the
  configuration option '--with-magma-lib'.  See Section II(d).


R Run-time Errors
-----------------

unable to load shared library '<path-to-magma-libs>/magma.so':
<shared-lib>: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
- Verify that the shared library <shared-lib> is installed with one of the two
  methods described in Section II(b).
