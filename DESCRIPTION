Description: Magma matrix classes and methods for parallel processing
        of matrix algebra operations.  Operations are performed with
        algorithms developed by the MAGMA research project.  MAGMA aims
        to achieve the fastest possible linear algebra libraries on
        hybrid multicore CPU and GPU architectures by exploiting their
        massive parallelism and minimizing communication latencies.
